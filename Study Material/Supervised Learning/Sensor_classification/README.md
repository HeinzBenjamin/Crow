It uses FireFly and two sensors:
 - Adafruit TCS34725 RGB sensor
 - 10bit pressure sensor (don't know the brand)

How to:

1. Install TC34725 driver (Google ftw)
2. Upload customized Firefly firmata to Arduino Uno using Arduino 1.0.3
3. Connect pressure sensor to A0 (w/ resistor)
4. Connect TCS34725 to A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL)
5. Run Neural_sensing.gh
6. Have fun!
